# The Rust compiler splits crates into multiple codegen units to parallelize (and thus speed up)
# compilation. However, this might cause it to miss some potential optimizations.
# You may be able to improve runtime speed and reduce binary size, at the cost of increased
# compile times, by setting the number of units to one.
codegen-units = 1
# Having full debug info in release builds can be useful for debugging/profiling, but it will increase the size of
# the binary.
debug = "full"
# Link-time optimization (LTO) is a whole-program optimization technique that can improve runtime
# speed by 10-20% or more, and also reduce binary size, at the cost of worse compile times.
