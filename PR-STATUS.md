# Pull Request Status

## Current Situation

We've reorganized the tree-sitter implementation from a single 21K-line PR into 4 manageable PRs:

### Branch Structure
```
main
 └─ pr/1-cst-foundation (6.5K lines)
     └─ pr/2-tree-sitter-parser (8K lines)
         └─ pr/3-testing-infrastructure (5K lines)
             └─ pr/4-ci-documentation (900 lines)
```

### PR Branches Created

1. **pr/1-cst-foundation** ✅
   - CST library foundation
   - Pre-commit framework (just added)
   - Ready to submit

2. **pr/2-tree-sitter-parser** ✅
   - Core tree-sitter implementation
   - Design patterns applied
   - Ready after PR 1 merges

3. **pr/3-testing-infrastructure** ✅
   - Comprehensive tests
   - Benchmarks and examples
   - Ready after PR 2 merges

4. **pr/4-ci-documentation** ✅
   - CI workflows
   - Documentation
   - Ready after PR 3 merges

## Next Steps

### 1. Delete/Close Existing PR
If you have an existing PR open, close it with a comment like:
> Closing this PR to reorganize into smaller, more reviewable chunks. Will submit as 4 sequential PRs for better review experience.

### 2. Create First PR
```bash
# Push the first branch
git push origin pr/1-cst-foundation

# Create PR on GitHub from pr/1-cst-foundation → main
# Use the template from pr-templates.md
```

### 3. Stack Remaining PRs (Recommended)
After creating PR 1, create the rest as a "stack":
- PR 2: `pr/2-tree-sitter-parser` → `pr/1-cst-foundation`
- PR 3: `pr/3-testing-infrastructure` → `pr/2-tree-sitter-parser`
- PR 4: `pr/4-ci-documentation` → `pr/3-testing-infrastructure`

This way each PR only shows its own changes, making review much easier.

## Pre-commit Setup

We've added pre-commit hooks to prevent the build failures you mentioned:

```bash
# On any branch, run:
./setup-pre-commit.sh

# This will catch:
- Formatting issues
- Clippy warnings
- Compilation errors
- Test failures
- Missing license headers
```

## Important Notes

1. **Each PR builds on the previous one** - they must be merged in order
2. **Pre-commit will prevent broken commits** - run setup on each branch
3. **Use stacked PRs** - GitHub will automatically update targets as PRs merge
4. **Reference the overall plan** - In each PR description, mention it's part of a 4-PR series
