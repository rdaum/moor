## What is this?

"**_Moor_**" is:

- A system for building shared, programmable, Internet-accessible virtual _social spaces_
- A programming and authoring _tool_ for shared environments.
- Fully compatible with [LambdaMOO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOO) 1.8.x

_Moor_ provides (from the bottom layer up...)

- A fast, durable, transactional database with object and relational characteristics
- A runtime for securely live-authoring and hosting programs and content that run persistently on that database
- An authentication and authorization system for controlling access to said programs ("verbs") and content.
- A programming language for building objects and verbs, along with the ability to plug in other languages / runtimes.
- Tools and user environments for interacting with the system and writing verbs and editing content.

And it is designed to be used for:

- Collaborative virtual environments
- Socializing
- Multiuser games
- Persistent agents
- Interactive fiction
- Your entertainment and delight

### Background

Launching in the early 1990s [LambdaMOO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LambdaMOO) is an online social environment, as well
as an open source software package for building such environments for yourself.

LambdaMOO -- the place -- still exists today, with an unbroken 30+ year history, and a small but dedicated community of users and
developers continue to use it -- both [LambdaMOO the place](https://lambda.moo.mud.org/), and
[MOO the server software](https://github.com/wrog/lambdamoo) for other communities.

MOO predates "social media", predates Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, Friendster, Tumblr, GeoCities, and... everything else.

In fact, it predates the world-wide web itself, and offers a very different kind of interaction with the Internet, one
that is synchronous and live, text-based, not graphical, and is based around an evolving narrative that the users themselves create.

It is a multiuser virtual world, a MUD, a narrative "game", a chat room, a virtual environment, a social network, a programming environment,
and a platform for collaborative fiction -- all in one.

It is a place where people can meet, talk, and build things together. And it's kind of awesome.

### Back to the Future

But it some senses, the actual technology did not age well at all. It lacks multimedia of any kind, its interface is
dated, it is not very accessible to new users, and the once active community of developers and participants has
dwindled to a small but dedicated group of enthusiasts.

And the server itself is aged; it is written in C -- is single threaded, with some known architectural limitations, and
is not very easy to extend or modify. While there are newer versions and forks (such as Stunt, ToastStunt, etc.) that
address many of these issues, they are still based on the same original codebase and architecture -- remaining bound by
the single-threaded, single-core model of the original.

_Moor_ is an attempt to reimagine LambdaMOO for the modern world, while retaining the core concepts and ideas that made
it so compelling in the first place. It is a ground-up rewrite (in Rust). And while it maintains full compatibility with
existing LambdaMOO "cores" (databases, worlds), it also offers a new, more flexible and extensible architecture, and
extensions to the runtime to make it more adaptable to modern use cases:

- A web-native architecture which allows for richer clients than a standard text-based terminal, including graphical
  clients, web clients, and mobile clients. Images, videos, emojis, rich text are all feasible, while keeping the
  narrative metaphor and creative aspects of the system intact.
- A multi-core, multi-threaded, runtime, with a transactional, multiversion concurrency model instead of a global
  lock on the database, as in MOO. This allows for theoretically greater scalability.
- A flexible, pluggable virtual machine environment which allows "verbs" to be written in alternative languages,
  such as JavaScript or WebAssembly modules (WIP).

### Why?

Socializing, authoring, and creating on the Internet is in many ways broken. We want to make it better, by giving people
tools to create their _own_ spaces, and to create their own _tools_ within those spaces.

It should be fun, it should be easy, it should be accessible, it should be open, it should be collaborative, it should
be programmable, it should be extensible, it should be secure, it should be private, it should be free.

### How do I use it?

The primary audience _at this time_ is developers and administrators of existing MOO environments, and people who are
interested in building new MOO environments, or people who are interested in extending this system out along the
vision described below (under _"What's next?"_).

If you're an existing MOO administrator, you can run your existing MOO database on Moor, and it should work just fine,
with the following caveats:

- No external network connection support or builtins for that. (Web front ends and alternative protocols are done
  in the Rust server layer, not in the MOO core.)
- No support for the extensions present in ToastStunt, Stunt, etc. (e.g. `map` type, WAIFs etc.). (Some of these may
  come in the future. Or not.)

The easiest way to get started is to run the `docker compose` setup. This will bring up a complete server with `telnet`
and `websocket` interfaces. The server will be setup with an initial `JaysHouseCore` core import.

To run, take a look at the local `docker-compose.yml` file, instructions are there, but it really just amounts to:

```
docker compose up
```

This setup is intended for development and testing. In particular, all binaries are compiled in (slower, fatter) debug
mode, and any changes to the source code will cause a rebuild of the server, and a restart of the server. This is useful
for development, but not for production.

However, the `docker-compose.yml` file is a good starting point for understanding how to run the server in a production
environment. The server is composed of a number of services, including the `moor-daemon` binary, and various
"host" services which provide the actual interfaces to the server.

### How is this thing put together? What even is it?

The server is written in Rust, and is composed of a number of crates and running services. These services communicate
with the main server process over an RPC system and message bus implemented on top of ZeroMQ.

For a high level architecture description plus a more detailed breakdown on how the server is put together, see the
[ARCHITECTURE.md](./doc/ARCHITECTURE.md) document.

### License?

_Moor_ is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3.0. See the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for details.

Why the GPL?

_But "The GPL isn't very popular these days", "my employer forbids me to contribute to GPL projects" ..._

- LambdaMOO itself is licensed under the GPL (version 2). And while the question of whether Moor is a derived work of
  it is a matter of debate (I did read its source code while developing), I see it as _ethical_ to keep the same license.
- The GPL encourages sharing of upstream work and collaboration, and that's what we want to do.
- I don't get paid to work on this, and while it's unlikely, I don't want to see it turned into a proprietary product
  that I can't use or contribute to. I want to see it used and improved by as many people as possible.

### Who made this?

Most of the work on this has been done by myself, Ryan Daum <ryan.daum@gmail.com>. Large chunks of the decompiler, and
various other pieces of code including code cleanliness and testing contributions, were done by Norman Nunley.

And there's been plenty of inspiration and help from a community of fellow old-school MOO
(and [ColdMUD](https://muds.fandom.com/wiki/ColdMUD)!) folks that I've known since the 90s.

Finally, LambdaMOO _itself_ was primarily authored by Pavel Curtis, with the original LambdaMOO server being written by
Stephen White. Successive versions and forks have been maintained by a number of people.

### What's done?

At this point `Moor` is capable of executing the full LambdaMOO 1.8.x language, and is capable of running existing
LambdaMOO databases. With some caveats:

- Persistent tasks are not yet implemented.
- Outbound network connections are not supported.
- Extensions present in ToastStunt, Stunt, etc. including map types, WAIFs, etc. are not supported.

For a list of the status of the implementation of standard LambdaMOO builtin functions, see
[builtin_functions_status.md](./doc/builtin_functions_status.md).

### What's next?

There's a lot of work to do. We're looking for contributors, testers, and users. We're also looking for feedback, ideas, and use cases.

We're also looking for funding, and for partners who want to build things on top of Moor.

The immediate horizon is to get the initial release out, which will be a drop-in replacement for LambdaMOO, with
some additional features. This will include a web-based client. To get there the following is still required

- Robustness and stability work.
- .... In particular around the custom in-memory database. This needs a lot of testing
  both in correctness and performance
- Correctness testing using tools like Jepsen and Stateright to prove out the transactional model & scheduler
- Performance testing to ensure that the system can handle a large number of users and objects.
- Support for persistent tasks
- And maybe outbound network connections, but that's a _maybe_.

The intent is to get to a 1.0 release after these are done. This 1.0 release will be fully compatible with existing
LambdaMOO databases, and will be a drop-in replacement for LambdaMOO.

The roadmap for **future** _features_ after the initial 1.0 release include:

- A more modern, web-based client. The start of this has been sketched out in the `web` host repository, but
  it's still very early. The intent is to provide a more modern, graphical, and interactive experience, while
  still retaining the narrative and creative aspects of a MOO. It will additionally provide modern authoring
  tools like a syntax highlighting, auto-indenting editor, a Smalltalk-style object browser, and a debugger.
  Some work on this has already been done.
  ![Example browser screenshot](./doc/browser-screenshot.png)
- Support for alternative languages and runtimes for verbs. The initial plan is to support JavaScript as a verb
  authoring language in addition to MOO. Verbs written in other languages will have access to the same object
  environment as MOO verbs, and will be able to call MOO verbs and be called by MOO verbs. Lua, and WebAssembly
  are also potential candidates for the future.
- Support for a richer data model which includes aspects of a logic programming language model. Programmers / authors
  will be able to declare first class relations between objects, and query them. The idea here is to take the
  grunt work out of building complex, multi-user, social systems, and to make it easier to build things that have
  complicated interactive behaviors.
- Support for multimedia content, including images, videos, and audio. This will be done in a way that is consistent
  with the narrative metaphor of the system, and will be programmable and extensible.
- A better permissions model, including support for more fine-grained access control, and a more modern, user-friendly
  interface for managing permissions. MOO-style fixed, knowable object numbers (`#123` style) will be replaced or
  subsumed by object-capability references. The challenge being to maintain backwards compatibility with existing
  cores.
