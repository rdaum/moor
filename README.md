# mooR

**mooR** is a network-accessible, multi-user, programmable system for building online social
environments, games, and collaborative spaces. Think of it as a virtual world where participants can
not only interact with each other, but also program and modify the environment itself.

mooR is a modern, from-scratch rewrite of [LambdaMOO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOO),
maintaining full compatibility with existing LambdaMOO 1.8.x databases while adding significant
enhancements.

üìñ **For comprehensive documentation, see our [mooR Book](https://rdaum.github.io/moor/).**

## What Makes MOOs Special

MOOs offer a unique digital experience through:

- **Collaborative storytelling** where participants build a shared narrative
- **Live programming** - modify the world while you're in it
- **Community-driven development** through persistent interactions and relationships
- **Rich interaction** that engages users through both traditional command-line and modern web
  interfaces
- **Complete customizability** - everything from objects to commands can be programmed

mooR builds on the foundation of MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons) and similar multiplayer online
environments that have fostered creative communities for decades. Like modern sandbox games,
MMORPGs, and social platforms, MOOs provide persistent worlds where players can build, create, and
collaborate. What sets MOOs apart is their emphasis on live programming and community-driven content
creation - imagine if Minecraft's creative mode, Discord's community features, and a code editor all
lived in the same space.

In a world of throwaway apps and walled gardens, mooR is cheerfully dragging the future into the
past - taking the best ideas from decades of online community building and rebuilding them with
modern technology.

## Status

mooR is approaching its 1.0 release and is currently in late alpha, with a focus on documentation,
testing and performance tuning. It successfully runs databases imported from LambdaMOO, with real
world workloads, and lives through our cruel stress and performance testing regimen.

Database formats and APIs may still change before the stable release, and we reserve the right to
keep adding features right up until the last minute.

## Key Features & Enhancements

**Runtime improvements:**

- Fully multithreaded architecture for modern multicore systems
- Native web front end with rich content presentation
- Directory-based import/export format for version control integration
- Modular architecture for easier extension

**Language enhancements:**

- All classic MOO features plus many extensions from ToastStunt
- Maps: associative containers (`["key" -> "value"]`)
- Lexically scoped variables with `begin`/`end` blocks
- List/range comprehensions (`{x * 2 for x in [1..5]}`)
- UTF-8 strings, 64-bit integers, booleans, symbols.
- Binary values.
- Lightweight immutable objects ("flyweights")

**Modern infrastructure:**

- Fast, durable, transactional database
- Support for multiple client protocols (web, telnet)
- Easy deployment via Docker

## Quick Start

The easiest way to get started is with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This starts three services:

- **moor-daemon**: The backend MOO service
- **moor-telnet-host**: Traditional telnet interface on port 8888
- **moor-web-host**: Modern web interface on port 8080

Connect via:

- **Web**: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (recommended for new users)
- **Telnet**: `telnet localhost 8888` (classic experience)

The server comes pre-loaded with JaysHouseCore, providing a ready-to-explore virtual world.

For more detailed setup instructions, see the
[Docker Compose Setup](https://rdaum.github.io/moor/the-system/docker-compose-setup.html) section in
the mooR Book.
