# Source for the mooR book

Points of interest:
- `install-tools.sh`: installs `mdbook` and friends. You should run this.
- `gen-from-stunt`: regenerates content from the Stunt manual. You should most likely *not* run this.
- `src`: the actual content.
- `theme`: styling and custom JS, like syntax highlighting.
