# Source for the mooR book

Points of interest:

- `install-tools.sh`: installs `mdbook` and friends. You should run this.
- `src`: the actual content.
- `theme`: styling and custom JS, like syntax highlighting.

# But I just want to read the book!

Actual book is hosted at https://rdaum.github.io/moor/
