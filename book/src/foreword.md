# Foreword

Hi, I'm Brendan aka Slither. I've been coding in MOO on [Sindome](https://www.sindome.org/) since 2003. I have spent many many hours over the years pouring over the original LambdaMOO programmers manual written by Pavel Curtis. In 2016 I set about updating the original manual with some of my learnings and it wasn't until 2019 that I finished work on it. Around the same time I heard about ToastStunt from [lisdude](https://github.com/lisdude). I wanted to get involved, but sadly, my C/++ coding skills are terrible. Thus, I decided my contribution would be to update the programmers guide to include all the changes that Toast has added, as well as further learnings and feedback from lisdude, DistantOrigin, and other members of the ToastStunt Discord server.

This guide is not just a technical document, it also contains opinions (mine and others) about what you should (waifs) and shouldn't (anonymous objects, multiple inheritance) consider doing and using. In the end though it's up to you. LambdaMOO and now its successor, ToastStunt, are amazing for creating games, hobby projects, and for tinkering or learning to code. I hope you have some fun!

## What is ToastStunt?

ToastStunt is a fork of [Stunt](https://github.com/toddsundsted/stunt) which is a fork of of [LambdaMOO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOO). At the time of this writing (01/01/22) ToastStunt was under active development. Stunt and LambdaMOO were not. If you are looking for an up to date, feature rich, LambdaMOO, then ToastStunt is for you. It incorporates much of the 'patches' that were released for legacy LambdaMOO, and much more (TLS, better
FileIO, updated and expanded built-ins functions, multiple inheritance, curl support, and threading to name a few).
