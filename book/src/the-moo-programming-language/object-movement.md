During evaluation of a call to the `move()` function, the server can make calls on the `accept` and `enterfunc` verbs defined on the destination of the move and on the `exitfunc` verb defined on the source. The rules and circumstances are somewhat complicated and are given in detail in the description of the `move()` function.
