# Running the mooR Server

Once you understand the different ways to get involved with MOO and the importance of cores, you're ready to tackle the technical aspects of actually running a mooR server. This section covers the practical mechanics of getting mooR up and running.

## Quick Start Guide

The fastest way to get mooR running is with Docker Compose, which handles all the complexity automatically. If you just want to get started quickly:

1. Clone the mooR repository
2. Run `docker compose up` in the repository root
3. Connect to your MOO via telnet on port 8888

For detailed instructions and other installation options, see the sections below.

## Understanding mooR's Architecture

Before diving into installation, it helps to understand how mooR is structured. Unlike traditional MOO servers that were single executables, mooR uses a modular architecture with multiple specialized components working together.

## Installation Methods

mooR provides several ways to get up and running, each suited for different needs and environments:

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

The easiest and most reliable method for most users. Docker Compose orchestrates all mooR components automatically, making it simple to get a complete MOO environment running.

### Alternative Methods

For specific environments or use cases, mooR also supports traditional installation approaches:

## Next Steps

Once you have mooR running, you'll need to:

1. **Choose and install a MOO core** - See [Understanding MOO Cores](understanding-moo-cores.md)
2. **Configure your server** - See [Server Configuration](server-configuration.md)
3. **Set up player access** - Configure telnet and/or web interfaces
4. **Customize your MOO** - Add content, modify settings, and create your virtual world

## Getting Help

If you run into issues:
- Check the specific installation guide for your chosen method
- Review the server configuration documentation
- Consult the mooR Codeberg repository for troubleshooting tips
- Ask the community for help in the forums or Discord
