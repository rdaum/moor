# The ToastStunt Database

In this chapter, we describe in detail the various kinds of data that can appear in a ToastStunt database and that MOO programs can manipulate. In a few places, we refer to the [ToastCore](https://github.com/lisdude/toastcore) database. This is one particular ToastStunt database which is under active development by the ToastStunt community.
