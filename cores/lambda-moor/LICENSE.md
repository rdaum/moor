# lambda-moor Licensing Information

This directory contains the lambda-moor core database, which is derived from LambdaCore.

## Licensing Status

**Complex/Unclear** - This core database is derived from LambdaCore, which has a complex historical
licensing situation.

## Key Points

### LambdaCore Origins

- Derived from LambdaCore distribution
- Original author: Pavel Curtis and the LambdaMOO community
- LambdaCore was distributed without an explicit license
- Contains contributions from many authors with no unified licensing
- **Original Location**: The official LambdaCore releases previously at parcftp.xerox.com are now
  available at https://lambda.moo.mud.org/pub/MOO/

### Historical Context

Pavel Curtis (original LambdaMOO author) stated in 1994:

> "Just FYI, neither Xerox nor I currently assert any copyright over any part of the LambdaCore code
> and I don't anticipate anything like that in the future. In particular, quite a lot of the core
> code was written by people who are neither Xerox employees or signers of any agreement with
> Xerox."
