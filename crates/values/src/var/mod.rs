//! TODO:
//!     to_literal / formatting
//!     move everything up and over into `../var`
//!     go through all uses of existing var and update them to use the new var
//!     any missed functionality along the way?
//!     more tests, and make pass moot once above is done
//!     later:
//!         more documentation
//!         builder vs reader mode? - optimization for values under construction.
//!         some From/Into impls for common types might be missing
