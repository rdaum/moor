//! StoredProgram - FlatBuffer-backed serializable representation of a Program.
//!
//! This wraps a FlatBuffer byte array with accessor methods, similar to how
//! VerbDef and PropDef work. The actual wire format is defined in
//! crates/common/schema/moor_program.fbs
//!
//! Flow:
//!   Disk → StoredProgram (ByteView) → decode → Program (runtime) → Execute
//!   (and same in reverse)
