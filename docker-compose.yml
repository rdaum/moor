# Example docker composition for starting up a mooR system, with a telnet server and a web server, and a worker process
# for handling outbound HTTP requests.

# This could be used as a starting point for a production system, and uses release builds of the mooR system as built
# by the Dockerfile in the root of the repository. A real production system would definitely need to consider its
# security and network layout, and this is just a simple example to get started with.

# The first time the system starts, it will import JHCore-DEV-2.db from the root of the repository. This is a recent
# JaysHouseCore database, with no modifications. After import, `development.db` will contain the database
# that resulted. To re-import the textdump, simply delete this directory.

# After this is running, a MUD client / telnet client can connect to port 8888 on localhost to interact with the
# system. (e.g. telnet localhost 8888). Or a websocket client can connect to port 8080 on localhost.

networks:
  # An internal network for the mooR system, to allow the different components to communicate with each other.
  # Note: We could use IPC sockets instead, and it would be more efficient, but by using TCP we can give an example
  # of how to use the system over a network if we were in a real distributed system.

services:
  # The core Moor daemon, which handles the database, scheduling and execution of tasks, and hosts the RPC server.
