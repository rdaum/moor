This is a simple "core" which shows how to use the (new to moor) objdefdir/object definition import format, which is
a readable, editable text import format for distribution of objects and MOO cores.

It corresponds basically to Minimal.db from LambdaMOO, having only a single player with an eval verb.

If there is no existing binary database, the daemon will read all .moo files in the directory and import.

TODO: More documentation on the format
