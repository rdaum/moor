/**
 * Model Layer
 *
 * This module contains the core data models and types for the Moor client application.
 * It's organized into several distinct areas of concern:
 *
 * 1. Domain Models - Core business entities (Player, Spool, etc.)
 * 2. UI State Models - Components for managing UI state (Notice, PresentationManager)
 * 3. Event Types - Types for server-client communication
 * 4. Application Context - Global state container
 *
 * The models here are designed to be reactive using VanJS State objects where
 * appropriate, and provide a clean separation between data and presentation logic.
